# Qt/QML Drone Controller
This is a simple application developed using Qt C++ and QML libraries in which user can pin locations on top of a QML Map. Then a drone (an image) will be flying to each point as per the order they were created

# How to build
1. Qt 5.7+ must be installed
2. Get a clone of the code and use Qt Creator to build the project. Tested on Windows using MingW 32 bit compiler.
